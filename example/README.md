# Example

This is an example on how to use the `terraform-libvirt` module.

This example will create 3 instances with the following names:

- `master`
- `node01`
- `node02`

And it is ready to apply [ansible-k8s-cluster](https://github.com/dyegoe/ansible-k8s-cluster) on it and create a Kubernetes cluster.
